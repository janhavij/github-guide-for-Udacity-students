Students will submit  HTML and CSS files for a web page that only requires the use of basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

Here's <a href="http://codepen.io/AndyAtUdacity/full/PwKdry/" target="_blank">one example</a> of what students could make and here is <a href="http://codepen.io/AndyAtUdacity/pen/PwKdry?editors=110" target="_blank">the code</a> that goes along with it.

## Project Specification
Your project reviewer will review and provide feedback on two aspects of your submission: the code you've written and the text you've written about what you've learned.

### 1 - Code Review
Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

* **Use of Syntax**: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML and CSS validation tests. 
* **Use of Logical HTML Structure**: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a `<div>` or `<span>`). 
* **Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling**: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class names.

### 2 - Content Review
In addition to looking at the code you write, your project reviewer will also read your notes to help ensure you have a good understanding of the most important concepts covered so far. They will be looking for:

* **Understanding of Structured Documents**: Your notes should demonstrate an understanding of what it means for computer code to be "structured."
* **The Importance of Avoiding Repetition**: Your notes should contain some explanation of why it's important to avoid repetition when coding.
* **Basic HTML and CSS knowledge**: Your project reviewer won't be looking for anything specific in this area, but will be providing general feedback about these two languages.
