Students will write server-side code to store a list of their favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Students will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers. 
## How will students complete this project? 
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer. 
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list. 
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py" target="_blank">fresh_tomatoes.py</a> - this module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies. 
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser. 

##Project Display Example 
**Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.** The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers:
